# Deploy a Dev Box service with customized iaage.

## Overview

This repository contains code to provision Azure DevBox into Azure. Microsoft Dev Box Preview gives you self-service access to high-performance, preconfigured, and ready-to-code cloud-based workstations called dev boxes. You can set up dev boxes with tools, source code, and prebuilt binaries that are specific to a project, so developers can immediately start work. If you're a developer, you can use dev boxes in your day-to-day workflows.
